# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities immediately to the current project lead. If you don't know who that is you can always email the club president at uvicaiclub@gmail.com.
Security updates should take place during the next sprint. Depending on the severity of the threat, it could be handled sooner or later.
