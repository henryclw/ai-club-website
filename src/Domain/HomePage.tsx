          <p> The preceding video is by Two Minute Papers and illustrates the advancements in AI research. The techniques and tools used here are based around neural networks which is evident from the iterations required to teach the agents. It's interesting how these types of AI agents seem to find unintended ways of winning the game. This technology could lead to solutions that human agents can not find.</p>
